0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

---

Background Context
Web static, what?
Now that I have built a command interpreter for managing my AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, ot os needed to build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything

During this project, I have learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages.
HTML is the structure of the page, and it was the first thing that was written. CSS is the styling of the page, which translates to the design.
